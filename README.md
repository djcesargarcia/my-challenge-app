# my-challenge-app

I follow this steps:

1. I create a project with React and I installed different packages to add styles like Material UI
2. I took a Card component.
3. I generated my Card component as URL.
4. I applied styles to center the component.

Finally, you can look the preview image to run project in your local server.
Happy Code :)
